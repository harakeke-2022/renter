Renter

Here is our first Retro

What didn’t go well:

-didn't fully think from the user perspective at first
-planning could be more precise
-could prioritize data flow a bit more
-a tiny tiny bit more communication

What went well:

-efficiency, work flow, making group decisions
-communication has been respectful and considerate
-everyone is super reliable
-taking the lead on what needs to be done
-honesty and openness
-self-care, up to date with each other’s energy levels
-resourceful, using Figma, Miro, tickets in github projects and facilitators

What we should continue doing:

-everything that went well as listed above
-communication, updating, ensuring smooth merges
-keep taking breaks 
-keep using facilitators
